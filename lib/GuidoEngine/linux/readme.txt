On linux, the GuidoEngine has to be installed from the source code, 
available from the sourceforge project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/guidolib/
The guido engine source code comes with cmake and includes an 'install' target.
This project requires the Guido Engine version 1.40 or greater. 
The corresponding release is currently available from the GUIDOLib 'mapping' branch only, and using svn.
