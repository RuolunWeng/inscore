This is a cmake configuration file, mainly intended to build a multiple architectures library on macos. To use, copy the cmake folder into the lua distribution (should be located at the same level than the 'src' folder) and run cmake as usually.
Note that the Release target output folder is the 'src' folder, thus the 'install' target of the lua Makefile works as usually.
