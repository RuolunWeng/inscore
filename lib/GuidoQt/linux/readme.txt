You should compile the GuidoQt static library from the GUIDOLib project.
The resulting binary is expected to be find in this folder under the name 'libGuidoQt.a'.
The project requires the library from Guido Engine version 1.40 or greater.
The corresponding release is currently available from the 'mapping' branch only and using svn.
