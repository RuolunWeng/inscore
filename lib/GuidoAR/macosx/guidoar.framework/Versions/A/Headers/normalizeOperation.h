\brief A visitor that produces a normalized version of a score.

	A score normal form is intended to compare scores. The normal form is based
	on pitch and duration only: it contains only voices, notes and chords, 
	where octave and duration are made explicit for every note.
	Thus, all the other tags are omitted (i.e. clef, meter slurs etc...). 
	However, we need to introduce a new specific \backward<dur> tag to catch
	the case where a single note is tied to a chord.
