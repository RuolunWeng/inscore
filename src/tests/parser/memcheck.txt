==4049== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==4049== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,

==4049== 
==4049== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==4049==   /path/to/gdb ./testparser
==4049== and then give GDB the following command
==4049==   target remote | /usr/local/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=4049
==4049== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
