INScore originates from the Interlude project.
It has been supported by the ANR (ANR-08-CORD-010)
====================================================

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12
- Remove GuidoQt library dependency and integrate source file.
- Inscrease size of guido item.
- Add arrow head attribute to line object.
- Bug correction :
	When ask for multiple exports, all are now treated and not only the last.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11
- new common queries ('get' message) : count and rcount that give the enclosed objects count
  and a recursive count. The messages are supported at scene and application level as well.
- new 'memimg' object that capture the image of any object hierarchy including scenes
- supports relative OSC addresses that are evaluated in the context of the target object 
  (i.e. a scene for drag & drop operations, arbitrary objects with the 'eval' method)
- new 'eval' method that takes a message list as argument, provided as a context for relative addresses evaluation
- Add new object httpd to create a http server to get image of the scene of the server object.
- Add new object websocket to create a websocket server to notify clients of a scene update and get an image of the scene.
- Guido font is now embed in INScore application.
- Partial support on IOS. Main problems are : antialiasing is not working and multi scene scores are not manage correctly.
- Bug in export item corrected : Child scaling was not apply.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10
- Files based objects support URL as path using an intermediate object that acts as a proxy during the download phase
- new events associated to url objects : success, error, cancel

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.09
- support for int values as parameters of the set method of rect shape and polygon objects
- the 'clear' message addressed to a 'gmnstream' object clears also the view. The change was not 
  previously reflected until a new valid string was posted to the object.
- bug in extended address support corrected: extended address was ignored for messages dropped to a scene .
- bug in window color corrected: black color was not correctly set due to an incorrect color 
  information returned by Qt.
- bug with 'line' initialization corrected: wrong position and orientation with negative coordinates,
  (was previously corrected but reintroduced), incorrect initialization in layers.
Known issues :
- colors may be wrong when exporting to pdf format, the bug appeared with the swith to Qt5.4.  

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.08 - 2014-12-15
- new __END__ marker supported to end a script parsing at arbitrary location
- when displaying the mapping, the map dates are not printed any more by default (due to size and collisions). 
  The debug map parameter change from boolean to int value: 1 to activate the mapping display, 
  2 to have also dates displayed.
- the signal node is available on any level of hierarchy (as well as the sync node)
- new 'connect' and 'disconnect' messages on the signal node to support signal connection 
  to objects graphic attributes
- a slave can have several masters
- no more side effects for synchronized objects (position change, scaling)
- some modifications on examples (Turenas and cursors) have been made : some settings of scale were 
in fact done to avoid side-effects that don't exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.07
- bug with 'line' initialization corrected: wrong position and orientation with negative coordinates.
- new 'plugins' static node at application level to provide a user path to look for pugins.
- explicit objects for musicxml scores ('musicxml' and 'musicxmlf' types)
- new 'faustdsp' object, charging libfaust as a plugin to compile faust DSP on-the-fly. 
- exception catched when sending osc messages: was a potential crash, 
  e.g. in case of 'get' message sent to a signal with a large buffer -> out of buffer memory
- new javascript 'post' function for posting delayed messages
- new 'write' method supported by the 'log' window
- variable addresses are evaluated in message based variables
- support relative rotations on x and y axis

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.06
- 'save' message can now take an optional list of attributes to be saved
- variables are now evaluated and expanded inside strings. 
  Thus interaction variables can now be passed as argument of javascript functions.
- corrects musicxml-version output
- log window is put to front when the show menu is recalled
- an object alias is removed when the object is deleted

- new watchable event: 'del' (triggered when deleting an object)
- validation tools
- new 'gmnstream' guido stream object (requires Guido engine v. 1.52)

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.03 - 2013-07-25
- log window utility provided as a new static node at application level (/ITL/log.
- new systemCount read only attribute for Guido scores

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.02
- IRCAM gesture follower support 
- javascript engine is available at the static address /ITL/scene/javascript and can be activated using a 'run' method
- bug correction: error messages not generated for dropped files (actually for the scene load method)
- bug correction: possible infinite loop in QStretchTilerItem::paint method
- bug correction: incorrect get alias output (all the aliases were dumped out in a single message)

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.01
- new 'export' event
- new 'endPaint' event at scene level
- new 'windowOpacity' method at scene level

----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.00 - 2013-01-28
- bug correction in streching very small objects (due to approximations)
- bug correction in $sx and $sy computation corrected (xorigin and yorigin was not taken into account)
- new 'ticks' message at application level for querying or setting the current count of time tasks.
- new 'time' message at application level for querying or setting the current time
- new 'forward' message at application level for messages forwarding to remote hosts
- new 'relative | absolute' synchronization mode

- fileWatcher methods renamed and simplified
- 'click' and 'select' messages are not supported any more.
- new 'stats' virtual node at application level (address /ITL/stats), supports 'get' and 'reset' messages
  the node gives statistics about the incoming messages
- crash bug in signal creation corrected: a signal size created with an incorrect stream 
  (e.g. a string value) was 0 and no buffer was allocated.
- extension of the time related events to duration: new 'durEnter' and 'durLeave' watchable events.
- new 'absolutexy' message at scene level to switch to absolute coordinates (in pixels).
- new 'push' and 'pop' messages to store and restore current watched events and associated messages.
- internal change: mappings are now implemented as a separable library strictly complying to the 
  mappings formalism.
- new %f format for the date variable to request a float value (instead a rational value).
- interaction messages are not any more generated when the date can't be resolved.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.99
- new 'rate' message at application level to control the time task rate.
- new 'frameless' message for the scene.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.98
 - new 'fastgraph' object for graphic signals fast rendering
 - $date variable overflow catched
 - files dropped on application icon correctly opened when the application is not running
 - supports drag and drop of textual osc message strings
 - osc error stream normalized: the message address is 'error:' or 'warning:'
   followed by a single message string.
 - javascript and lua support: 
   a single persistent context is created at application level and for each scene.
   It allows scripts to reuse previously defined functions and thus design more structured scripts.
   Note: the effect of 'load' message is actually to push the messages on the system stack for
         further evaluation. Thus when including a file containing javascript (or lua), the new 
         language context won't be available to the next messages in the script. The workaround 
         for structured script consists in designing a top level script that only contains 'load'
         messages.
