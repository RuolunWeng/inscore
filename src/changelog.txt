----------------------------------------------------
INScore originates from the Interlude project.
It has been supported by the ANR (ANR-08-CORD-010)
====================================================

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.82
- new Faust plugins for signals processing
- colors management change: all the color models (RGBA and HSBA) accept now
  float values that are interpreted in the common [-1,1] range. For the
  hue value, 0 always corresponds to 'red' whatever the scale used.
- stretch adjustment for video objects (corrects gaps in sync h mode)
- support for opening inscore files on the command line
- system mapping correction
- splash screen and about menu implemented by the viewer

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.81
- behavior change with synchronization without stretch: now the system looks also in the
  slave map for a segment corresponding to the master date.
- $date variable change: the value is now (0,0) when no date is available
  the $date is time shifted according to the object date
- date message change: the date 0 0 is ignored

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.80
- corrects the map not saved by the 'save' message issue (version 0.79)
- corrects 'get map' output: 2D segments were not correctly converted to string

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.79
- crash bug corrected for the 'save' message addressed to '/ITL'
- message policy change: relaxed numeric parameters policy 
  (float are accepted for int and int for float)
- bug in 'get watch' for time events corrected (incorrect reply)
known issues:
- map not saved by the 'save' message 


----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.78
- guido system map extended (flat map or subdivided)
- new transformations messages (shear and rotate)
- new 'rename' message to change objects name (and thus OSC address)
- relaxed bool parameter policy: objects accept float values for bool parameters
- automatic numbering of exports when destination file is not completely specified 
  (no name, no extension)
- quantification introduced to $date variable
- reset message addressed to a scene clears the scene rootPath

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.77
- get guido-version and musicxml-version messages supported by the application (/ITL address)
- 'save' message bug correction - introduced with version 0.70:
   only partial state of objects was saved
- 'rootPath' message introduced at scene level
- scene name translation strategy change: only the explicit 'scene' name is 
  translated by the scene load message handler into the current scene name, 
  other names are left unchanged.
- bitmap copy adjustment in sync stretched mode is now only made for images

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.76
- new 'require' message supported by the /ITL node (see documentation)
- new event named 'newElement' supported at scene level
- new 'name' and 'address' variables
- new system map computation making use of the new slices map provided by the
  guidolib version 1.42
- INScore API: the newMessage methods set now the message src IP to localhost
  With the previous version and the lack of src IP, replies to queries or error 
  messages could be sent to undefined addresses (and mostly lost).
- bug corrected with ellipse and rect : integer graphic size computation changed 
  to float (prevents objects disappearance with small width or height)
- bug in scene export: left and right borders could be cut, depending  on the scene size
  corrected by rendering the QGraphicsView container instead the QGraphicsScene
- crash bug with $date:name corrected: crashed when there is no mapping named 'name'.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.75
- new map+ message for incremental mapping
- click and select messages are deprecated
- bug in utf8 path name handling corrected (for 'img' and 'video' types)
- guido staff graphic map correction: staff change was not correctly detected

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.74 - March 10 2011
- new 'dpage' message accepted by 'gmn' objects 
- x and y variables: automatic range type detection (int | float)
- polymorphism for the set 'txt' message params
- set 'txt' message: accepts stream like parameters

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.73
- bug in message based variables output corrected
