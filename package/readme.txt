 General information
======================================================
The Interlude Viewer provides augmented music score capabilities.
An augmented score is a graphic space that provides representation, 
composition and manipulation of heterogeneous music objects, 
both in the graphic and time domains. 
It supports arbitrary resources like music scores, images, 
text, vectorial graphics and signals representations. 
It focuses on the graphic synchronization of its components, 
according to their time relations and on signals representation.

The Interlude Viewer has no user interface, it is intended to be 
controled via OSC messages i.e. by any external application that 
supports the OSC protocol (typically MaxMSP or Pure Data).

======================================================
