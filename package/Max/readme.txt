The Max folder contains various folders provided as examples of the 
Interlude Score Viewer use. They require Max version 5.

You should launch the InterludeScoreViewer application before opening the 
enclosed .maxpat files. In case you don't, most of the patches have a reload 
button to reload the Interlude score.

The interlude.maxpat file is a general score viewer controler and the 
filePlayer.maxpat is a subpatch of interlude.maxpat.
