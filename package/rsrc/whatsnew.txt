Samples scripts have been reorganized: standalone scripts are now in a 'Standalone' folder.
Samples making use of symbolic music scores (gmn, gmnf, gmnstream, musicxml, musicxmlf) have 
been updated to take account of the new default size for music scores (which is 8 times the 
previous size) .

Update of all the scripts that are using the synchronization mechanisms in order to adjust the
slaves size. An object graphic behavior has changed when synchronized: now, objects are keeping 
their dimensions but take the parent attributes for scale. This design is a consequence of the
synchronization extension to multiple masters.
