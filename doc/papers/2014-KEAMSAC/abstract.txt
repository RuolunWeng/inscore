INScore is a dynamic music score viewer that can be controlled in real-time using Open Sound Control [OSC] messages as well as using an OSC based scripting language. It supports extended music scores, combining symbolic notation with arbitrary graphic objects. All the objects of a score have a time dimension and can be synchronized in a master/slave relationship i.e. any object can be placed in the time space of another object. INScore supports also sound or gesture representations as first order objects of the music score, and viewed as graphic signals. The system has been used in concerts - notably for interactive music pieces -, for music analysis, and electro-acoustic pieces representation and modelisation. Its flexibility makes it suitable for pedagogical applications as well.

The paper will address music representation issues in the context of the contemporary music creation and will explain INScore's contribution in the landscape of music notation software. It will give an overview of the system with a presentation of its main features and highlights on the main technologies involved. It will include concrete examples of use with recent music creations, and composers viewpoint on the system. Concrete examples of electro-acoustic pieces modelisations will also be given.
