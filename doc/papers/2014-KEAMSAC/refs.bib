	Abstract = {INScore is an environment for the design of interactive music scores that includes an original event-based interaction system and a scripting language for associating arbitrary messages to these events. We extended the previous version by supporting scripting languages offering a great flexibility in the description of scores and in the interactions with scores. The textual format is directly derived from the OSC message format that was defined in the original INScore version. This article presents the scripting language and illustrates its ability to describe interactions based on events, while remaining in the temporal space. It also introduces the IRCAM gesture follower and how it is embedded into INScore to provide gestural interaction capabilities..},
