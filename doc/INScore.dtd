 Description
    The Interlude Mapping File [IMF] format is an XML-based language aimed at 
    a comprehensive description of relations between time and arbitrary resources.

<!--
    Root Element
    Includes an optional general description of the mapping file
    and the mapping itself. 
    Mappings are currently supporting relations between time space and one dimension 
    or two dimensions spaces.
    Attributes are:
    - version: the IMF format version used
    - creator: the optional name of the file creator

    The ispace attribute indicates how the resource intervals should be interpreted:
    - relative intervals should be float intervals included in [0,1] 
      where 1 corresponds to the resource size.
    - absolute intervals contains values in the resource dimension space 
      (e.g. lines and columns for a text resource)

<!--
    related_file element is intended to indicate a file resource,

    The name attribute could be an absolute or relative path name as well as an url

    An interval has two attributes: a start and end values.

    Values should express positions according to the ispace setting.

<!--
    A time_interval contains time position expressed in relative time 
    (metronomic time), which may be viewed as a virtual time.
    Values must be rational values where 1 represents a whole note duration.
    The rational format should be 'n/d', when 'd' is omitted, it is assumed to be 1.
